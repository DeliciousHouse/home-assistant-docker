## why an 'about' folder?

I did not want to call this the `doc` or `docs` folder 
to avoid confusion with the name `docker`. 
I was going to pick `help` but I thought that `about` 
was likely to appear near the top alphabetically.

## no wiki?

I love wikis, but I want to keep documentation in as a part of the project, 
especially as Home Assistant documentation already sprawls widely. 


## choice of license

I chose MIT license for a simple and permissive license, 
as the project does not distribute any other works directly itself, 
so is not bound by 'upstream' limitations.

Home Assistant, Docker and other software used with this project 
use different licensing models that you may need to consider
