# Installing Docker


## Options


For Ubuntu we install Docker CE (Community Edition)

* The recommended approach is 
	- to set up Dockerâ€™s own repositories and install from them. 
	- This is what most users do, for [ease of installation and upgrade](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-engine---community). 
	- it's not that hard
* Alternatively you might 
   - use the 'get.docker.com' _convenience script_ as it is even simpler 
   - but is not normally recommended outside dev and test environments. 
* DO NOT
	- be tempted by the Ubuntu installer to take 'docker snap package' option. 
	- it can be buggy and you may end up spending more time applying fixes


## Preferred way - docker repos


```
# credit https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# test
sudo docker run hello-world
```

If you have issues check you are using the correct distro page, e.g. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#set-up-the-repository

## Alternative - get.docker.com


```
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### UNINSTALL manually

If you used this alternative method, then decide to revert to the preferred method above...

```
# credit https://serverfault.com/a/722472
sudo apt purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
```

then start again at the Preferred Way above.


## That's it

Now you are all ready to use this repo - go back to the [README](/README.md)
